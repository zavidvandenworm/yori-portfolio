                    My hobbies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a variety of interests, but one of my primary passions is archery. I'm a member of HBS De Ster in Echt.

                    Another hobby I love is painting Warhammer 40.000 miniatures. This is something I share with my girlfriend, and while I am not good at the game itself, I find a lot of joy in painting these miniatures.

                    Gaming is another aspect of my life that brings me great pleasure. I'm particularly drawn to titles developed by FromSoftware, including Bloodborne, Elden Ring, Dark Souls series, and Armored Core. I also love games made by Capcom. The Monster Hunter series is my favorite game series ever. Additionally, I love classic Pok√©mon games, especially those made before the Nintendo Switch era.

                    Several games have left a lasting impact on my journey toward becoming a game developer. Games like Outer Wilds, Terraria, Baldur's Gate 3 and Hollow Knight have served as inspiration to become better, fueling my passion for game development. Despite its flaws, Ark: Survival Evolved holds a special place in my heart as my favorite game.
